TAEB has a number of debug commands. While he's playing, you can just type them
in.

If you're using the Human AI, go into debug-command-mode with ~. This
is for the greater good, trust me. :)

TAEB's debug commands follow. If you have any ideas for more commands, please
share.

~
    Open up a REPL. You can do things like:
        Take control:
            TAEB->ai("TAEB::AI::Human")
        Query TAEB's stats:
            TAEB->hp
            TAEB->maxhp

;
    Look around the map. Works a lot like NetHack's ; command. The 'g' is for
    'glyph' and the 'f' is for 'floor_glyph'. You can go to different levels
    with > and <. If there is another level at your depth you can use v to
    switch branches. Finally, you can use i to see the items on the tile.

r
    Redraw the screen, in case it got garbled.

p
    Pause TAEB until you type any other key. Note that the key you type will
    be totally ignored. This often screws me up because I expect it to be
    a debug command. :)

s
    Turn on single-step mode which will automatically wait for a keystroke
    after each turn.

S
    Toggle sanity check mode, in which TAEB's mental model is checked for
    consistancy after every action.

Esc
    Send the next keystroke to NetHack directly. If you need to do multiple
    keystrokes, switch to the Human AI or use the REPL to print to the socket.

q
    Makes TAEB save and exit at the next command. Slightly better than ^C.

Q
    Makes TAEB quit the current game, immediately.

d
    Change the current color_method used to render the map

i
    Show TAEB's inventory.

^P
    Show old messages.

^X
    Show TAEB's senses.

e
    Show TAEB's equipment.

I
    Show item spoiler data.

M
    Show monster spoiler data.

t
    Select a type tile to show known instances of.
